Tests parameters in a structural design: 
Structural design with parameters of different type. 
Tests propagation of default values as well as overloaded values.

Uses existing module Param as a sub modules.
Note: maybe it would better to make Param a submodule of ParamStruct and avoid dependencies between tests.
