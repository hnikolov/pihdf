Tests HSD interface with different configurations:
- width: 1 bit, 64 bits, fields
- buffering: with and without
- terminated: input and output

IGP test that measures the ipg on the width 64 interface is included.

The design is structural, includes two consecutive pass though modules with many interfaces of different types.
